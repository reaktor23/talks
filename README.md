# Talks

Abuse Github Issues to handle requests for Talks to be held.

## What?

A talk */tɔːk/* is a kind of lecture or presentation where a speaker is sharing his knowledge or ideas to an audience.

We in Reaktor 23 try to have those talks in irregular intervals to share knowledge, sometimes in a on-demand fashion because one or more persons are touching a specific topic. 

Those talks should be not too long and allow room for questions, examples and even hand-ons. Target a presentation time of somehow 30 to 60 minutes.

## Request / offer a Talk

- Create a issue with a brief description about the talk
- Assign the label **Talk** and/or **Workshop** to it depending on what it should be
